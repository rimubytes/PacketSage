/**
 * @file hardirqs.bpf.c
 * @brief eBPF program to monitor hardware interrupt handling latency and count
 *
 * This program attaches to hardware interrupt entry and exit tracepoints to:
 * - Count interrupt occurrences per interrupt name
 * - Measure interrupt handling latency (in ns or Î¼s)
 * - Generate latency distributions using log2 histogram
 * - Optionally filter by cgroup
